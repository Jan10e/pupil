This repo contains pupil diameter analysis scripts. The scripts differ depending on data structure. 
The PupilLoop.m is specifically for JPEG files, created for lab members in the McCormick lab, Yale University.

The broad idea of these pupil measurements is to firstly perform edge detection to extract estimates and features that can be used in the ellipse fitting function. 
The coefficients and parameters of this function are then used to compare the pupil diameter fluctuation across time.
